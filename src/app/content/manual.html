            <h2>Manual Ethereum wallet/ Buy Ether</h2>

            <p>So you have already bought bitcoin but now you want Ether, the underlying coin (or token) of the Ethereum network, but you don't know how ? </p>

            <h4 class="top50">You are at the right address, we are going to explain it to you step by step.</h4>

            <p>This manual assumes you already have bitcoin. If this is not the case; it's not yet possible to buy ether with creditcard or a method other than bitcoin yet, it is in the planning though.</p>

            <p>The process of exchanging bitcoin into ether is fairly simple. In just a few steps it can be accomplished. What you need first is the official Ethereum wallet and a bitcoin containing some coins. Both wallets need to be completely synced. Being synced means it should be up-to-date and it has downloaded the blockchain..</p>

                            <h4>Step 1. Download the official Mist Ethereum Wallet</h4>

                            <p>The first step is to download the Mist wallet.</p>

                            <p>You can do this in several ways. The easiest way is to go to <a href="https://ethereum.org/">ethereum.org</a>, scroll a bit down and press the download button, the right version is automatically presented to you (e.g. for windows, macos). First you need to agree to the disclaimer (it is warning you that ethereum doesn't accept any responsibility).</p>

                        </div>

                        <div class="col-md-4 text-right">

                            <a href="https://ethereum.org/"><img src="/assets/images/mist.png" style="width:250px;"/></a>
                        </div>
                    </div>


                    <p>You can also look in <a href="https://github.com/ethereum/mist/releases">github</a> to see if there are new releases.</p>

                    <p>After installation it is necessary to sync the wallet by downloading the blockchain. Don't be afraid, the happens pretty much automatically. The blockchain is a ledger of all transactions that ever occurred on the Ethereum network. It takes some time before it's up-to-date.</p>

                    <p>After installation your Ethereum wallet looks like this:</p>

                    <img src="/assets/images/ethereum-wallet.jpg"/>

                    <p class="top50">
                        There is a difference between accounts and wallets. An account you already have on opening the wallet for the first time (it's called Etherbase), on this account you can send and receive Ether, the only downside is that you cannot see the transactions.</p>

                    <p>A wallet functions the same as an account but does contain transactions. Before you can create a wallet (in which you can see transactions), you need some Ether in your Etherbase account to pay for the wallet. This is only a very small amount buyt by charging the user, spam and abuse is prevented.</p>

                <div class="col-md-12">
                    <h4>Step 2. Make a backup of your mist wallet</h4>

                    <p>Go to Accounts -> Backup -> Accounts.</p>

                    <p>Save the backup in a safe place, preferably on an external harddisk, or a location that is regularly backupped.</p>
                </div>

            </div>

            <div class="row top50">

                <div class="col-md-12">
                    <h4>Step 3. Open your bitcoin wallet and make sure it's up-to-date</h4>

                    <p>If you are using Bitcoin-QT (the standard wallet for bitcoin) you can check in the bottom right if he is fully synced/ up-to-date. If you didn't have the wallet open for time it can take a while before it's synced. If you are using electrum or for example a webwallet it's already up-to-date en it will be fast or instant.
                        </p>

                    <p>A mobile wallet that is good and easy to work with is the one from <a href="http://www.blockchain.info">blockchain.info</a>, the advantage of a mobile wallet is that it is very easy to scan a qr code.</p>

                    <p>Once a wallet is up-to-date you are ready for the next step.</p>

                    <h4>Step 4. Copy your Ethereum address of your base account (Etherbase)</h4>

                    <p>In the following image you see which address that is:</p>

                    <img src="/assets/images/etherbase.png"/>

                    <p>You can quickly select the address by double-clicking on it with the mouse.</p>

                    <h4>Step 5. Paste your Ethereum address in the widget en complete the form</h4>

                    <p>In the picture you can see how the widget looks with your Ether address pasted into it.</p>

                    <p>ATTENTION: if you make a mistake here and don't provide the correct Ethereum address, or for example, remove 1 character by accident, you will NOT receive your order. </p>

                    <p>You also need to provide the number of ETH you want to order.</p>

                    <p>At the moment there is a max of 0.5 BTC worth of Ether that can be bought through the widget.</p>

                    <p>If you want to buy the maximum amount of Ether, you can just fill in 0.5 BTC in the BTC input field. The right number of ETH is automatically calculated.</p>

                    <p>You also need to provide your e-mail address, there you will receive updates of the order process. You will immediately receive the first update after you pressed the green button.</p>

                    <p>ATTENTION: the pictures do not contain the real widget. The real widget is in the top of the page.</p>

                    <h4>Step 6. Place the order and make the payment</h4>

                    <p>If you press on the green button you will see the QR code, like in the picure.</p>

                    <p>If you have the possibility to scan the QR code with for example the APP of blockchain.info then you can use the QR code, the amount is also prefilled in that case.</p>

                    <p>Otherwise you can copy paste the address and the amount, to your bitcoin wallet of choice and do the transfer from there.</p>

                    <p>After the transaction is recognized on the bitcoin network, a confirmation mail is sent out.</p>

                    <p>In between 5 to 10 confirmaties the transaction is see as definitive and the actual exchange is performed.</p>

                    <p>Then the Ether will be transferred automatically to the ether address you specified.</p>
